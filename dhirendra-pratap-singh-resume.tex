% \runsubsection{Codeforces Lamp}
% \descript{| \href{https://github.com/hanisntsolo/codeforces-lamp}{View on GitHub} }
% Developed an innovative automation tool that changes colors based on a user’s Codeforces submission status. Integrated with the Tuya API using Python and Flask, and deployed as a Dockerized service for public use. Users can easily customize the setup by configuring environment variables, allowing anyone to visualize their competitive programming progress in real time.

% \runsubsection{Auto-committer}
% \descript{| \href{https://github.com/hanisntsolo/auto-committer}{View on GitHub} }
% Automated repository management solution designed for frequent file changes, particularly on private cloud platforms or JupyterLab environments. This tool tracks modifications and automatically commits them to the repository, preventing data loss and ensuring all files are consistently backed up in real time.

% \runsubsection{GitHub Resume Project}
% \descript{| \href{https://github.com/hanisntsolo/resume}{View on GitHub} | \href{https://resume.hanisntsolo.com/}{View my Resume} }
% Created a streamlined, modern resume template using LaTeX, aimed at professionals who want to automate resume deployment. The project integrates with GitHub Workflows to automatically deploy the resume to a public endpoint. Users can fork the repository to build and maintain their own public resume in just a few steps.

% \runsubsection{FAANG-CRACKER}
% \descript{| Coding Tool (In Progress) | \href{https://faangcracker.hanisntsolo.com/}{Check it out!} }
% Building a custom tool designed to help engineers prepare for FAANG interviews by automating problem-solving workflows. It integrates with Codeforces and LeetCode APIs to pull problems and track user performance. Built using Next.js and Node.js with WebSocket support for real-time code compilation. The tool currently supports Java, Python, C++, and JavaScript, offering a personalized and streamlined interview preparation experience.
