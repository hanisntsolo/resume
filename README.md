# The Resume Project

This repository contains the LaTeX source files for my resume and is set up to automatically compile and deploy the resume to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

## Steps to Set Up

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hanisntsolo/resume.git
cd resume
```

### 2. Set Up GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a GitHub Actions workflow to compile the LaTeX document and deploy it to GitHub Pages.

Create a file `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: Compile LaTeX document

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

permissions:
  contents: write  # Explicitly set the permission for the GITHUB_TOKEN

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up LaTeX
        uses: xu-cheng/latex-action@v2
        with:
          root_file: dhirendra-pratap-singh-resume.tex
          compiler: xelatex
          args: -output-directory=output  # Specify output directory
          
      - name: Copy index.html to output
        run: cp index.html output/index.html  # Copy index.html to output directory
        
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./output  # Directory containing your compiled PDF
          destination_dir: ./  # Directory where the site will be hosted
```

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages

Go to the repository settings on GitHub and navigate to "Settings" > "Pages". Ensure the source is set to the `gh-pages` branch and the folder is `/ (root)`.

### 4. Verify File Placement

Ensure the compiled PDF is located at:

```
https://hanisntsolo.github.io/resume/dhirendra-pratap-singh-resume.pdf
```

### 5. Create a Redirect `index.html`

Create an `index.html` file to redirect from `https://hanisntsolo.github.io/resume` to the PDF file.

```bash
# Ensure you are on the gh-pages branch
git checkout gh-pages

# Navigate to the resume directory
cd resume

# Create the index.html file
echo '<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=dhirendra-pratap-singh-resume.pdf">
    <title>Redirecting...</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Redirecting to <a href="dhirendra-pratap-singh-resume.pdf">dhirendra-pratap-singh-resume.pdf</a></p>
</body>
</html>' > index.html

# Add and commit the file
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add index.html for redirecting to renamed PDF"

# Push the changes
git push origin gh-pages
```

### Access the PDF

- **Direct PDF URL:** `https://hanisntsolo.github.io/resume/dhirendra-pratap-singh-resume.pdf`
- **Redirect URL:** `https://hanisntsolo.github.io/resume`

### Clearing Browser Cache

If you face any issues with redirection, try clearing your browser cache or accessing the URL in an incognito window.

### Summary

This setup ensures that the LaTeX document for your resume is automatically compiled and deployed to GitHub Pages. The compiled PDF is accessible at the specified URL, with an `index.html` file ensuring a smooth redirection.

By following these steps, you can maintain and update your resume efficiently.



Deedy-Resume
=========================

A **one-page**, **two asymmetric column** resume template in **XeTeX** that caters particularly to an **undergraduate Computer Science** student.
As of **v1.2**, there is an option to choose from two templates:

1. **MacFonts** - uses fonts native to OSX - *Helvetica*, *Helvetica Neue* (and it's Light and Ultralight versions) and the CJK fonts *Heiti SC*, and *Heiti TC*. The EULA of these fonts prevents distribution on Open Source.
2. **OpenFonts** - uses free, open-source fonts that resemble the above - *Lato* (and its various variants) and *Raleway*.

It is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

## Motivation

Common LaTeX resume-builders such as [**moderncv**](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/moderncv-cv-and-cover-letter)  and the [**friggeri-cv**](https://github.com/afriggeri/cv) look great if you're looking for a multi-page resume with numerous citations, but usually imperfect for making a thorough, single-page one. A lot of companies today search resumes based on [keywords](http://www.businessinsider.com/most-big-companies-have-a-tracking-system-that-scans-your-resume-for-keywords-2012-1) but at the same time require/prefer a one-page resume, especially for undergraduates. 

This template attempts to **look clean**, highlight **details**, be a **single page**, and allow useful **LaTeX templating**.
